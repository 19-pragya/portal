{"name":"Systers Portal","tagline":"Systers Portal for Communities","body":"![Systers](http://systers.org/systers-dev/lib/exe/fetch.php/systers-logo-300x60.png?w=200)\r\n\r\n# Welcome to Systers Portal Project\r\nSysters strive to help women improve or develop their technical skills so they are contributors in open source and other technical communities. We have several projects we work on as a community as well as part of Google Summer of Code and Google Code In ([melange](http://www.google-melange.com/)).\r\n\r\nCheck out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nBefore rebranding and new website, ABI ([Anita Borg Institute](http://anitaborg.org/)) had a section/pages for Systers and each subgroup (Latinas, LGBT, Black Women in Computing, TurkishWiC and ArabWiC). This allowed for subgroup members to find information particular to their community or main Systers community.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nThe portal project is to have admins from Systers and subgroups to provide the same information above in one portal area.  A portal for Systers and sub-groups to share information to perspective communities, lists events and by geography. Before rebranding and new website, ABI (Anita Borg Institute) had a section/pages for Systers and each subgroup (Latinas, LGBT, Black Women in Computing, TurkishWiC and ArabWiC).\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project started as part of Systers Google Summer of Code 2014 students.
